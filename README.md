# Build forex target data
As personal project I'm interested in applying machine learning to forex data. I'm interested in ML algorithms and want to sharpen my skills of applying them.

This repo demonstrates the processing of forex tick data adding target columns for stop/losses within a window of time. The emphasis on the code is in creating these new fields efficiently. By writing object oriented code directly, it's likely that this process can be parrallelised should this be needed further down the line.
